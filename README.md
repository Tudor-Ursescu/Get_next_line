# Get_next_line - Function that reads a line from a file descriptor

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**get_next_line** is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, dynamically managing memory to ensure efficient reading. The bonus version extends functionality to handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously, making it useful for reading from multiple files or input sources concurrently.

git clone https://github.com/Tudor-Ursescu/Get_next_line.git
cd Get_next_line
```
In order to run the mandatory part:
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c gnlTester/gnlMain.c -o gnl_tester
./gnl_tester
```
In order to run the bonus part(multiple FDs support):
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c gnlBonusTester/main2.c -o gnl_bonus_tester

Hello, this is file 3.
This is still file 1.
This is still file 2.
This is still file 3.
You will exit file 1.
You will exit file 2.
You will exit file 3.
```
## ðŸ›  Notes
- Make sure BUFFER_SIZE is properly defined for optimal performance.
- Always free() allocated memory to avoid leaks.
- Bonus version ensures independent reading from multiple files.
